xlogin display manager
----------------------

Or xlogin for short, is a display manager for the console. Instead of launch X for logins, we start a login like daemon (xlogin) who attempts to login a 
user. Works the same as 'login' program but performing basic security checks.
Those security checks make fail all actions performed by user polkit agent (lxpolkit in lxde) but actions from root running polkit works (eg. automount)
X Display managers increase too much complexity of login system (X security, widget app as modal window, a lot of dependencies, etc)

xlogin is launched, as login, from getty like program. Takes a single param, username to test for login. After a succesful login tty is freed by xlogin 
and X is launched on the same tty. Which session is started is configurable via xloginrc. First value found is executed (with exec family functions) 
Read xloginrc file shipped with xlogin tarball for more options.

Performs session recording (utmp like) if available.

Currently only support a single head, but could very easy to extend.

Have support for PAM. And uses syslog/systemd for error reporting. Only glibc dependent.
X session could be started without shell access by the logged user, for increased security.

As added feature, perform checks for securing cookie for MIT_MAGIC_COOKIE X authentication. Ánd disable listens of Xserver to tcp and abstract socket.

Tested with lxde on gentoo, archlinux and archlinux32. And worked with mingetty and agetty.

Intended audience: X (desktop) users worried with security.

BUILD
-----

GNU autotools ready (read INSTALL for step by step guide. This package don't include any test). Some customization is possible, read 'configure --help'. Defaults to use PAM, if available; but could be disabled with --without-pam to configure.

For installing xlogin in /bin/xlogin call configure with options, as user,

$ configure --prefix=/usr --bindir=/bin --sysconfdir=/etc/xlogin

Recomended keep CFLAGS and LDFLAGS as defaults for preserving hardening features.

$ make

Maybe you want to test installing with DESTDIR prior to root install. When ready install as root,
# make install-strip


SETUP
-----
- For sysv init, edit /etc/inittab from,

c7:2345:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 tty7 linux

to,

c7:2345:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 tty7 linux -R -l /bin/xlogin

if you're using mingetty,

c7:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty7 --loginprog=/bin/xlogin

Adjust to your tty number. After that, run 'telinit q' as root. If tty7 have running a agetty prior to telinit, you have to kill its proccess too.

- For systemd init, a file need get installed on /etc/systemd/system/getty@tty1.service.d/xlogin.conf, for configuring agetty for xlogin (lxde ready).
Adjust to your tty number. Pick that file from xlogin directory as root,
# mv /etc/xlogin/xlogin.conf /etc/systemd/system/getty@tty1.service.d/.

- If you are using PAM you need copying login config,
# cp /etc/pam.d/login /etc/pam.d/xlogin

- xlogin is lxde ready, but if you want to customize, edit /etc/xlogin/xloginrc. Read that file for more hints.

NOTE: After you perform all corrections to your system, you could see a error message 'No session for pid XXX' (or similar) on login.
If you don't want to see that, remove definition of user polkit agent in lxde application selection (lxpolkit), let that box empty.
( Go to Start -> Preferences -> Predeterminated applications for LXSession; goto 'Basic applications' tab and blank 'PolicyKit Agent' box, from 'lxpolkit' to empty field)
You have to do that for each lxde user on your system.

SECURITY SETUP REQUIRED
-----------------------

- be sure /proc is mounted with options hidepid=2,gid=proc
gid=proc part is necesary for lxde to work with full desktop (automounting with udisks for example). But if you don't have dbus support compiled could omit it.
write a line in /etc/fstab like this,
proc	/proc	proc	nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,hidepid=2,gid=proc

- select yama ptrace_scope to 3.
Edit /etc/sysctl.d/yama.conf, or similar sysctl file, and set
kernel.yama.ptrace_scope = 3

- if an user can't log in with xlogin, look at syslog messages for problems encountered by xlogin and correct it. With systemd issue a 'loginctl -r' perhaps as root and with systemv look at /var/log/messages or dmesg as root.
